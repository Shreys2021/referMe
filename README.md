 This web application facilitates user registration, login, and referral tracking. It is designed with a clean and user-friendly interface using Django as the backend framework and Bootstrap for responsive front-end design. The core features of the application include:  Key Features: User Registration:  Users can sign up by providing their email, name, mobile number, city, and an optional referral code. Form validations ensure that mandatory fields are filled correctly (e.g., mobile number must be exactly 10 digits). User Login:  Registered users can log in using their email and password. Invalid credentials result in error notifications. Referral Tracking:  Logged-in users can view a list of individuals they referred, including their names, emails, and cities. Navigation Buttons:  Clear navigation between login and registration pages through well-placed buttons. Error Handling:  Real-time error messages are displayed for invalid inputs (e.g., duplicate emails, incorrect referral codes). Responsive Design:  Designed with Bootstrap to ensure the app looks and functions well on both desktop and mobile devices.
